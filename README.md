# Password Generator Starter Code

# <Creating password generator by randomization>

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to use JavaScript to build out a password generator through randomization using the Math object in conjunction with the methods .random and .floor as to create safe and strong password for employees that provides greater security. The password generator takes in data from specific prompts that the user inputs and returns a password that fits within the criteria the user chooses. This will allow for each user to create a unique and secure password. Through this process I have implemented many of the techniques we have been learning about in JavaScript such as the use of string variables, functions, conditional if statements, and iteration. I furthered my understanding of these techniques in practical application, learned about the correct ES6 syntax (let & const), when one should use a while loops vs a for loop when iterating, empty string variables, prompts, and parseInt methods.

## Features

Features of this page are very user intuitive. When the 'generate password' button is clicked, the user will be taken through a series of confirm prompts which will allow each user to choose the character types they want to included in their password (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and the password length). After all prompts are answered, then the generated password will appear on the screen within the 'your secure password' text box.
